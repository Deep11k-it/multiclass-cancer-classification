# 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset used in this project consists of medical images categorized into multiple cancer types along with their respective sub-classes. It is organized in a structured directory format with separate training and testing folders.

## 🧬 Cancer Types Included
- Breast Cancer
- Kidney Cancer
- Lung Cancer
- Oral Cancer

## 🏷️ Sub-Classes
Each cancer type contains type-specific sub-classes representing clinical conditions such as:
- Benign
- Malignant
- Normal
- Tumor
- Cancerous

> Sub-class labels vary across cancer types; therefore, a hierarchical classification approach is adopted.
